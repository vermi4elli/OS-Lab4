# OS-Lab4
## The task
The task for the lab is to find critical path and critical time in an oriented, weighted, acyclic process graph.
To get everything clear:
> __Critical path__ is the longest path from a given vertice to the END vertice.   
     
At the same time,     
> __Critical time__ is the time it takes to travel the critical path from the given vertice.
